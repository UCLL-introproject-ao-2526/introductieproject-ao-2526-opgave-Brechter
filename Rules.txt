=General
The aim of the game is to get a score of 21 with the cards you pull.
The numbers have their own value, 10 through king are all worth 10 and the ace is 1 or 11.
You play against the dealer and the one with the highest score wins, but score over 21 result in a loss.

=Gameplay
Both you and the dealer will start the round with two cards, the dealer's second card won't be revealed yet.
To pull a card from the deck, you press the 'hit' button, if you want to stop your turn you can press 'stand'.
Your turn will automatically end if you go over 21 or if you have 7 cards (which wins you the game).
The dealer will start his turn by turning over his second card, then he'll start pulling cards until he exceeds 17.

=Betting
You can bet any multiple of 20 coins for every game, pressing bet will add 20 to your total.
You can always reset your bet amount to 0, but you have to bet something to start the game.
If you win you get your money back twice, tieing just gets you your money back and losing loses your money.
A blackjack (21) will get you your money back 2.5 times.

=Insurance
If the dealer's first card is an ace, you can buy insurance before starting the game, this is half your bet.
If the dealer gets a blackjack you will get your insurance back twice, if not you'll lose it.

=Card count
If you turn on cheats, you'll see a card count. 
If that count is high, you're best of to bet high. if the count is low, you better bet low.
The count will increase with a number 2 through 6 and decrease with 10 through ace.
